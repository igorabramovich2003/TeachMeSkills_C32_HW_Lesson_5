# Here, the following tasks are implemented:

## 0. Create a three-dimensional array of integers.
### Using loops, "go" through the entire array and increase each
### element by a given number. Let the number by which each element will
### be increased be specified from the console.

## 1*. Chessboard
### Create a program to color the chessboard using a loop.
### Create a two-dimensional array of 8x8 Strings. Using loops, set the
### elements of the loops to the values ​​B(Black) or W(White).

## 2*. Multiplication of two matrices
### Create two arrays of integers (two matrices).
### Write a program to multiply two matrices.
### First array: {{1,0,0,0},{0,1,0,0},{0,0,0,0}}
### Second array: {{1,2,3},{1,1,1},{0,0,0},{2,1,0}}
### Expected result: 1 2 3 1 1 1 0 0 0

## 3. Create a two-dimensional array of integers. Print the sum of all elements of the array to the console.
